# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via patches on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_xml_backend).


## Patches

- **[Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. (Well, they might be, but tests will make it easier.)

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ ../../vendor/bin/phpunit
```


**Happy coding**!
