INTRODUCTION
------------

This module provides site builders with additional options for the 'summary'
field when using "Text Area with a Summary" widget.

Often, a summary or teaser field is used when displaying content in views.
Drupal already has built in support for a summary field, however there is not
much control of whether or not it is display, or required.
