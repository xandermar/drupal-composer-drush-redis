INTRODUCTION
------------

Taxonomy is a very helpful tool in Drupal's world. However, support for
"machine_name" is really missing, overall when you need to exchange terms
with others systems. In such situation, the only way is to create a field
to hold external term code which is not the best way due to poor performance
consequences.

This module create a new property named "machine_name" as for Taxonomy
Vocabulary to store a "slug" for each term, and a "unique key" index to
check unicity into a vocabulary. If not provided during term creation,
machine name will be automatically generated based on term name.

This new property can be used too with pathauto to generates rewrited urls.
